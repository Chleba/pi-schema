/**
 * Schema-inspired decision tracking for the pi agent harness.
 *
 * Inspired by the Schema harness (schema-harness.github.io) which achieves
 * ~99% on ARC-AGI-3 by forcing models to:
 * 1. Encode beliefs as executable programs (not implicit context)
 * 2. Validate against every recorded transition (certify phase)
 * 3. Plan inside a verified simulator (free planning)
 * 4. Maintain an append-only Timeline (immutable observations)
 *
 * This module wires that pattern to the pi agent loop with three hooks:
 *
 * - `beforeToolBatch`: capture the assistant's declared plan/expected in
 *   memory (the "deliberation" snapshot). Returns a `planId` that is passed
 *   through the loop so `afterToolBatch` knows which plan to record.
 * - `afterToolBatch`: classify the outcome using the loop-provided `hasErrors`
 *   flag (the canonical error signal — never text-matched from raw output),
 *   then write ONE `DecisionEntry` with the full plan/expected/actual/outcome.
 * - `onModelRevision`: when a batch fails, produce a revision prompt the loop
 *   injects as a custom message (`schema_revision`) so revision artifacts stay
 *   separate from user/assistant history and don't pollute context.
 *
 * Decisions live in the Timeline (append-only JSONL) and the LLM-visible half
 * of the Timeline is the recent-decisions digest injected into the system
 * prompt each turn via `SessionManager.getRecentDecisionsDigest`.
